# Note: We are using this because its the base OS used by Hyak compute nodes
# The idea is that We have the best chances to find slurm modules of the 
# exact right versions to integrate into the container, and this will make
# it possible to build off hyak and run on hyak, with minimal scripting
# done at runtime for things like mpi which requre same version inside and 
# outside the container 

Stage: devel
# Primary reasons to do stages were size and control of MPI impl. The thought is to 
# Avoid choosing an exact version of MPI at build time so long as a "close enough" version is in use
# and then swap out the libraries at runtime. This has the advantage of not having to build 
# the container on Hyak because automating a build process there is annoying due to auth-ing into
# a compute node.
# 
# Size was not much benefit, currently keeping it to avoid build stage having to be on hyak
